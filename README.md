# A Simple Web Page

###### My first web page I have built from scratch.

###### It has images, links, and text formatted for readability (using ordered and unordered lists).

## This is my practice project to learn:

- HTML
- Web Development
- Responsive Design
- User Interface (UI)
- User Experience (UX)
- Semantic Markup
- Accessibility
- Cross-Browser Compatibility
- Frontend Development
- Code Structure
- Clean Code Practices
- Version Control (Git)
- Problem Solving
- Project Management
- Collaboration
- Attention to Detail
